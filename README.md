A google colab Notebook for the regression analysis of the (Boston Housing prices dataset)[http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston] using the Keras API in python.

##### 1. The Dataset
The Boston housing prices is a small dataset containing 506 cases with 13 training attributes describing the houses and the median house price in thousand dollars as the target attribute.

##### 2. The Model
For this dataset a Shallow Neural network gave better results as compared to a deep network due to its small size. On training the network the mean absolute error on the test data was ~2.5k dollars which  is an acceptable error in the case of housing prices.
